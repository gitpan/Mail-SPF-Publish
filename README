NAME
    Mail::SPF::Publish - Assist in the creation of DNS records for the SPF
    standard.

SYNOPSIS
      use Mail::SPF::Publish
 
      spf_mailserver( "mail_one", "mail1.example.com", "10.0.0.1" );
      spf_mailserver( "mail_two", "mail2.example.com", "10.0.0.2" );

      spf_domainservers( "example.com", "mail_one", "mail_two" );

      spf_fix_recursion();

      print spf_output_bind9();

DESCRIPTION
    This module and it's associated sample code are intended to be used to
    generate DNS records (tinydns and BIND9 so far) for SPF, including any
    explicit wildcard recursion if necessary. The interface right now is
    /very/ questionable as this has not been proofread by anyone yet. Please
    be warned that this module may change considerable or not at all before
    first release.

USAGE
  spf_mailserver

  spf_domainservers
     Usage     : spf_domainservers( domain, alias, ... )
